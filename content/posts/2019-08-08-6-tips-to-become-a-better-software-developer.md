  As a software developer, I know how busy we are and how many different ideas
  we got in our minds: learn and study new techs, fix bugs, contribute to open
  source, start a business, etc.  


  Can you count the number of new tools which came up since last year? 


  I sometimes ask myself what is the secret to becoming a successful software
  developer, although I believe the word success is extremely subjective. It
  depends on each person and on their goals.  


  I do not believe in a magic secret to become a successful software developer,
  **but I think that if** we start to take care about ourselves, plan and set
  goals, study and work hard, it's definitely become easier. I wrote this
  article to share some important things which are continuously helping me to
  become a better software developer. Hope you'll find it useful.

1. ## Take care of yourself

![tired-of-coding](/media/shutterstock_57890992.jpg "tired-of-coding")

I often see people complaining about being **always tired.**  As a software developer I know sometimes we want to do a lot of things, study and learn, then we stay up until late and wake up early in the morning, etc. I already had dreams with code and solution for some bugs, it was at same time exciting and scaring. \
\
I have defined a rule for myself: **one of the most precious things in my life is my health** and without it I will not accomplish my goals, build my ideas, learn new things, etc.

Is not easy to change habits, but the first step is look to ourselves and identify that you need to modify something to improve your life quality. If you are one of those persons _who is tired of being tired_, why not have a look on what might be causing this? It's not easy, you can start  with small steps to improving your life quality as exercise, have enough sleep, eat healthy food, etc. There is a lot of available content, books, etc that can help you on this task. 

Time flies, so take care of your self now and remember that health is one of the most important things that you have in your life, if you waste due bad habits, the software that your build or the knowledge that you got might not bring it back.

2. ## Keep yourself updated

![](/media/keep-yourself-updated.jpeg)

This is one of the most important and hard things in my opinion. We are super busy at work, and is almost impossible to know every single technology, language, framework, etc.

I believe that one of the most important skills for a software developers is how willing they are and how quick they can learn new things. Everything in IT/Software development is changing everyday and super fast! 

Getting to know what is coming new in the market is really important and I like to use this quote:

> I don't need to go deep and understand how every single new tool/language works under the hood, but at least I should be aware that it exists, understand how it works (even superficially) and what it is used for.

I have worked with different technologies in the last years and the great thing is that as I knew at least what they were and how they basically works, it made the learning process easier. I used and learned a lot of tools just because I knew that they could help me to solve this problem.

Some tips to get updated about new tools:

* **Be curious:** Whenever I listen or watch someone talking about software development, one of the first thing I do is save this word somewhere and then google it later to understand what is this. Curiosity is a really helps me a lot to keep connected with a lot of new things. When I access some websites, one of my first thinkings is: what tools/frameworks were used to build it?
* **Twitter:** Twitter is one of my favourites, it has a lot of awesome professionals which is daily sharing a lot of useful content and news about software development. If you are keen to keep updated about some topic, just create a twitter and search for people and companies which are on your field. I can't spend one week anymore without scrolling my timeline and reading all awesome tweets about techs. Does not matter if you are keen in Javascript, React, NodeJs,  Python, Machine Learning, Devops, Database, etc, it always gonna have a lot of useful content (I follow a lot of companies/people from all of this list above and much more). 
* **Talks:** I love to watch talks, specially talks which big companies does explaining how they build their infraestructure and which technologies they are using. In each video I usually learn a lot of new tools and techniquies and immediately google and read more about them. Sometimes I use the phrase _You don't need to reinvent the Wheel,_ and a lot of big companies like netflix, airbnb, etc has a lot of amazing talks about their challenges and solutions.
* **Read/Blogs:** We have a lot of plataforms as (dev.to)\[https://dev.to/], (medium)\[https://medium.com] and more which has a lot of content about software development. In the most part of them you can set yourself notifications to receive emails whenever new content about your interest is published.
* **Github:** Github has an (explore function)\[https://github.com/explore] which contains trending repositories and much more. I also follow a lot of awesome software developers and IT companies to see what they are up to.
* **Stackoverflow:** Sometimes I search random questions order by date on (stackoverflow)\[https://stackoverflow.com/questions?tab=Newest] just to see what people are asking questions about, and whenever I found a new tool name I quick google it just do understand what it is.
* **LinkedIn:** I often keep connected with some people which I have worked with and also sometimes I do some browsing in big IT companies and people to see in what they are working on, what technologies they are using. 

3. ## Improve and challenge yourself 

If you are working with any framework, try to go deep and understand how it works, what are the best practices and never do any line of code without knowing why you are doing on this way. I

Here are some habits which I created and have been really useful for me:

* Read official documentations. 
* If you get struggle in any bug and find a solution in the internet, don't copy & paste any code without understand it. (_If you don't have time on the moment, do it later_)
* Google "what is the best way to do ... in NodeJs" what you want to
* If the framework/language that you are working on has a github repository or twitter profile, etc, follow it and keep updated about new changes. 
* You should also follow the people who are working on it. A lot of them have twitter profile and share some awesome information in few lines of tweet. Here goes some people who I follow: 
  * React: Dan Abramov (https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)
  * Angular Angular In Depth (https://twitter.com/AngularInDepth)
  * Javascript - Testing: Kent C. Dodds . (https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)
* Browse the source code it or try to run it locally (I know it might be hard to understand all the source code from a entire framework, but you can start trying to understand how each component/piece works).
* Whenever you get a bug on console open source code and find where this message came and why. I was developing a web application and angular a few months ago and always had angular source code open, whenever I got stuck in a bug I always open the source code and searched for the message then I can understand better.
* Find meetings/conferences about it. If you can't go you can either watch it later or see what topics were discussed on.
* Contribute and share knowledge: I am always repetitive, the best way to learn is sharing knowledge. If possible, try to contribute with the community, sometimes you can even contribute on the documentation if you are not familiar with the code. You can also write blog posts or tutorials about it :)
* Read, read an read. The internet has millions of content, do not hesitate do read posts, books to understand better then tool that you are working on.
* Do not forget step 1 of this article.

## 4 - Share your knowledge

One of my favourites as well. I believe the most part of software developers become really happy when they feel useful, and has no better way than feel useful to help someone. Furthermore, everytime when you write about something I believe it is one the best way to memorize and learn more about it. 

This is my second blog post and I have no plans to stop on it. Hopefuly I will manage my time to try to write at least 1 blog post each two weeks :)

* Create a personal blog and write about something new that you have learn in your work. 
* If possible, get into your IT community , you can use apps like (meetup)\[https://www.meetup.com/] for that.
* Answers questions on (stackoverflow)\[https://stackoverflow.com/].
* Respond issues or contribute to open source projects in (github)\[https://github.com/]. 

## **5 - Plan, organize and set goals.** 

Even if you are a high skilled software developer, without planning and focus is really hard to achieve your goals. I found my self lost in a bunch of different ideas, things to study and learning and was really hard to really finish/accomplish something. 

Time is one of your most precious thing, so it's really important to use it efficiently. I used to start to do something then suddenly I got my self scrolling twitter timeline or reading another different article.

I realised that I was not focused and not using my time correctly.  I love to read

I bought my self a white board and decided to every week plan what tasks I want to do for my professional career and 

Last year I bought my self a white board where I keep all goals/plan for every week and it's have helped me a lot. 

* Make a plan which all technologies/subjects you would like to study/learn.
* Set Goals
* Focus. 

## 6 - Be kind with everyone and yourself

This does not apply only for IT Professionals but for any kind of professionals. A high skilled software developer is great, but is really important to develop Human aspects in software developer. On the end of the day, we are creating new things for people, so is really important to keep kind and treat.

* Don't get hard on yourself when you don't know something. Nobody borns knowing everything.
