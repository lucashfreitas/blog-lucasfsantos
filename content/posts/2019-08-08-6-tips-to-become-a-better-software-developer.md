  As a software developer, I know how we are always busy and usually have a lot
  of ideas in mind: learn and study new techs, fix bugs, contribute to open
  source, start a business, etc.  Can you count the number of new tools which
  came up just in last year from now on? t's indeed super exciting, but one of
  the things which define successful people is how they use and plan their
  habit. I often see a lot of successful people and ask my self what is the
  secret, but I believe that is no secret, but if you take care of your self,
  plan your self and work hard, it's definitely you paid on. I am writing this
  article to give some tips that have been really useful and has helped me to
  become a better software developer, IT Professional in general.

1. ## Take care of yourself

I quite often see a lot of people in IT Field which is **always tired.**  As a software developer, I know how we are always busy and have a lot of ideas in mind: learn and study new techs, fix bugs, contribute to open source, start a business, etc. I know sometimes we stay up until late and wake up early in the morning, etc, but in the last months I have been asking my self: is nothing in this life more precious than your health, so if you have a goal in your professional career you need to take care about yourself, always remember: without it you are not going to develop your ideas, learn new ideas, etc. 

Is not easy to change habits, but the first step is look to ourselfs and see how can you improve your. If you are always tired something might be wrong, everyone talks it but is not hard to take small steps on improving your life quality as exercise, have enough sleep, eat healthy food. I used to eat a lot of junk food , soda everyday but as soon as my mindset changed I quit. A lot of friends of mine make joke about it, saying things like: "Oh, you don't drink coke, what if you die tomorrow?". I always respond: If you do everything thinking you gonna die tomorrow mate, honestly? 

If I sleep well, have a balance diet and exercise does not means necessarly that I will have a better life than someone who does not do that, but I believe at least that is a better chance (What a chance).

The time flies, so take care of your self now because if you get yourself in a hospital bed because of bad healthy habits, the software or company your build will not matter anymore. 

2. ## Keep yourself updated

This is one of the most important and hard things in my opinion. We are super busy at work, and is almost impossible to know every single technology, language, framework, etc (don't feel bad about yourself because of it)

I believe a good software developer is who is willing and can quick learn, but I also think that after some years of experience is good to become specialist in something (it does not means that you gonna be able to work only with this, but at least you will be good at it). 

In the other side, getting to know what is coming new in the market is really important, I often say: 

You don't need to go deep and understand how every single language, tool, framework works under the hood, but at least you should try to understand what it is and what it is for.

I am still new in tech field but I have worked with different technologies in the last years and the funny is that I know how its useful, because in the most part of times when some colleagues ask me about a new tool, I knew about it, even further, I used and learned a lot of tools just because I knew that they could help me to solve this problem.

Some tips to get updated about new tools:

* **Be curious:** Whenever I listen or watch someone talking about software development the first thing I do is save this word and then google it later to understand what is this. Curiosity is a really good thing for me and helps me a lot to keep connected with a lot of new things. A lot of times when I access some website my first thinking to know is what tool/framework was used to build it. I believe we have some browser extension for that.
* **Twitter:** Twitter is one of my favourites, it has a lot of awesome professionals which is daily sharing a lot of useful content and news about IT and General. If you keen to keep updated about some topic, just create a twitter and search for people and companies which are on your field. I can't spend one day anymore without scrolling my timeline and reading all awesome tweets about techs. Does not matter if you are keen in Javascript, React, NodeJs,  Python, Machine Learning, Devops, Database, etc, it always gonna have a lot of useful content (I follow a lot of companies/people from all of this list above and much more). 
* **Talks:** I love to watch talks, specially talks which big companies does explaining how they build their infraestructure and which technologies they are using. In each video I usually learn a lot of new tools and techniquies and immediately google and read more about them. Sometimes I use the phrase _You don't need to reinvent the Wheel,_ and a lot of big companies like netflix, airbnb, etc has a lot of amazing talks about their challenges and solutions.
* **Read/Blogs:** We have a lot of plataforms as (dev.to)\[https://dev.to/], (medium)\[https://medium.com] and more which has a lot of content about software development. In the most part of them you can set yourself notifications to receive emails whenever new content about your interest is published.
* **Github:** Github has an (explore function)\[https://github.com/explore] which contains trending repositories and much more. I also follow a lot of awesome software developers and IT companies to see what they are up to.
* **Stackoverflow:** Sometimes I search random questions order by date on (stackoverflow)\[https://stackoverflow.com/questions?tab=Newest] just to see what people are asking questions about, and whenever I found a new tool name I quick google it just do understand what it is.
* **LinkedIn:** I often keep connected with some people which I have worked with and also sometimes I do some browsing in big IT companies and people to see in what they are working on, what technologies they are using. 

3. ## Go deep into technologies that you use in daily basis 

If you are working with any framework, try to go deep and understand how it works, what are the best practices and never do any line of code without knowing why you are doing on this way. I

Here are some habits which I created and have been really useful for me:

* Read official documentations. 
* If you get struggle in any bug and find a solution in the internet, don't copy & paste any code without understand it. (_If you don't have time on the moment, do it later_)
* Google "what is the best way to do ... in NodeJs" what you want to
* If the framework/language that you are working on has a github repository or twitter profile, etc, follow it and keep updated about new changes. 
* You should also follow the people who are working on it. A lot of them have twitter profile and share some awesome information in few lines of tweet. Here goes some people who I follow: 
  * React: Dan Abramov (https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)
  * Angular Angular In Depth (https://twitter.com/AngularInDepth)
  * Javascript - Testing: Kent C. Dodds . (https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)
* Browse the source code it or try to run it locally (I know it might be hard to understand all the source code from a entire framework, but you can start trying to understand how each component/piece works).
* Whenever you get a bug on console open source code and find where this message came and why. I was developing a web application and angular a few months ago and always had angular source code open, whenever I got stuck in a bug I always open the source code and searched for the message then I can understand better.
* Find meetings/conferences about it. If you can't go you can either watch it later or see what topics were discussed on.
* Contribute and share knowledge: I am always repetitive, the best way to learn is sharing knowledge. If possible, try to contribute with the community, sometimes you can even contribute on the documentation if you are not familiar with the code. You can also write blog posts or tutorials about it :)
* Read, read an read. The internet has millions of content, do not hesitate do read posts, books to understand better then tool that you are working on.
* Do not forget step 1 of this article.

## 4 - Share your knowledge

One of my favourites as well. I believe the most part of software developers become really happy when they feel useful, and has no better way than feel useful to help someone. Furthermore, everytime when you write about something I believe it is one the best way to memorize and learn more about it. 

This is my second blog post and I have no plans to stop on it. Hopefuly I will manage my time to try to write at least 1 blog post each two weeks :)

d

* Create a personal blog and write about something new that you have learn in your work. 
* If possible, get into your IT community , you can use apps like (meetup)\[https://www.meetup.com/] for that.
* Answers questions on (stackoverflow)\[https://stackoverflow.com/].
* Respond issues or contribute to open source projects in (github)\[https://github.com/]. 

5 - Plan, organize and set goals. 





6 - Be kind with everyone and yourself
