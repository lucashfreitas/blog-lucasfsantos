  In many situations, especially for SaaS applications, we can have multiples
  web applications using the same components, layouts, features, services, etc.


  Let's imagine you have to set up the same web application with the same data
  structure for different customers, then you might need to change little things
  such as images, colors, and all the data with is sitting on your backend CRM
  system. (I will use contentful in this example).


  We will use Gatsby Theme which is perfect for this situation. We'll share
  components, services, graphQL queries, pages, everything!


  It's easy, simple to maintain & deploy.
