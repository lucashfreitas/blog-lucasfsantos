## Who Am I?

I am an energic software developer from Brazil based in New Zealand. I moved to New Zealand in 2018 and since then I am still living and working here. I love to deal/solve problems, specially when I have to learn something to solve them.

## A bit more about my background

I have experience as a Software Developer working with different stacks and programming languages following agile methods for 6 years. I am quick to understand business requirements, learn new technologies and deliver practical solutions. Besides technical skills, I am friendly, communicative and work well within a team.

In the most part of job positions I was involved directly in all SDLC, from the business requirements to the deployment. I consider my self a self-taught developer as I am always updated with latest technologies/tools ([here is how I do it](https://lucasfsantos.com/5-tips-to-become-a-better-developer)). I had to learn and implement new tools in the most part of roles that I have been working.

For the last two years I have been working mainly with:  

* Business Analysis/Requirements
* JAM Stack (Gatsby, Contentful)
* Web Api's Design/Development (HTTP Protocol, Security, REST, Performance)
* FullStack Javascript/Typescript Development (Angular , React, Node, NestJs, etc).
* SQL Databases design & development (Design Databases, Complex Queries, Performance, etc).
* AWS Cloud Development/ Management (Serverless, ApiGateway, CloudFormation, AWS Beanstalk, AWS CodePipeline, EC2, ELB, CloudFront, S3, ElasticCache, AWS Amplify, etc). 
* CI/CD (Set up pipelines, tests, automated deployments using AWS CodePipeline, Circle CI, Bitbucket pipelines, etc)

## What else I am good at?

* Experience with software architecture/enterprise applications in different languages such as .NET and Java. (MVC, SOLID, Spring, etc)
* SEO (Audit, Best practices, Google Tag Manager, Search Console/Analytics)
* Short experience in native mobile development (Objective C and Java)
* Microservices/Event driven architecture _(Even though I never implemented any production app using it, I know how to use/architect a scalable micro services (Message Brokers, Stream Processing - Kafka, etc, Event Streams/Buses, Api Gateway)_
* Infrastructure as a code (Cloudformation & terraform)
* Design Mind Maps to validate / start new ideas.

## What I have achieved so far?

* On the first two years of my career, I have been working mainly with .NET & SQL development, I have built a web system which is being used since 2014 by a medium size catering company to manage all of it's internal processes. This work was used as my final thesis and achieved maximum score, you can find all design/solution [here](https://www.monografias.ufop.br/bitstream/35400000/221/6/MONOGRAFIA_DesenvolvimentoSistemaInforma%c3%a7%c3%a3o.pdf).
* I have been working with complex ETL/SQL queries, Web Api development and deployment and have delivered many backend/web api's systems using .NET, SQL which are being used by more than 500.000 users in Brazil. 
* I worked on the conception, design and development of a brand new product called [Beduka](https://www.beduka.com) which works like a google, gathering all information about courses and universities in Brazil. We have used Java, .net, elastic search and mysql.
* On my current role at navigate travel, I work developing and managing all IT resources and also leading software development projects. I have been working mainly with Cloud development, Web Api and Javascript full stack development. We have achieved many things together, as a migration of a huge enterprise system using JS/TS, the development of brand new websites using React and many other things.
