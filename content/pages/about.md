## Who Am I?

I am an energic software developer based in New Zealand. I love to deal/solve problems, specially when I have to learn something to solve them. Have a interesting project/idea? Feel free to reach out. 

## A bit more about my background

I have experience as a Software Developer working with different stacks and programming languages following agile methods for 8 years. I am quick to understand business requirements, learn new technologies and deliver practical solutions. Besides technical skills, I am friendly, communicative and work well within a team.

In the most part of job positions I was involved with all software development cycle, from the business requirements to the deployment. One of the things that keeps me motivated it's to learn new things, that's why I love to read and try to be always updated with latest technologies/tools ([here is how I do it](https://lucasfsantos.com/5-tips-to-become-a-better-developer)). I had to learn and implement new tools in the most part of roles that I have been working on.
